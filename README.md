# SocialApp

This is a basic example of a an Angular 2 + Bootstrap3 app. I've build this project using Angular CLI, which I highly recommend. The Angular CLI lets you build Angular components, modules and services very fast and very efficiently.

As discused above, this project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.

To run the project you have to create a development server on your machine using Angular-cli

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
