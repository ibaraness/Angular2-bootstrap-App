# Simple Angular2 and Bootstrap3 App

Hi this project is a basic example of a an Angular 2 + Bootstrap3 app. I've build this project using Angular CLI, which I highly recommend. The Angular CLI lets you build Angular components, modules, Classes, Guards and services very fast and very efficiently.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the project you will have to install Node and NPM on your machin.

Ususally NPM come packaged with Node, so you probably only have to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

You can check if Node is istalled by running the following in terminal or CMD in windows:

```
node -v
```
It should give you the version number. If you get as error, you probably don't have Node running on your machine.

If the test went well you can do the same to check NPM:

```
npm -v
```

### Installing

Download the project to your machine, or clone it using git to your prefered directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/ibaraness/Angular2-bootstrap-App.git
```

After that, in the same directory install all dependencies using

```
npm install
```

### Running the project

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
